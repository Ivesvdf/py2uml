# Py2UML #
## What is Py2UML ##
A script for converting python code to a UML-style class diagram. 

The script will output graphviz code which can be piped into a graphviz
engine, like dot. 

At the moment, this should be used like 

    find src/ -type f -iname "*.py"  | xargs python py2uml.py | dot -T png -o test.png

Later on, support for entire directories will appear...
